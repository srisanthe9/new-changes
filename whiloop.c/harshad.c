/*
Write a program in C to find a number is harshad number or not using while loop taking input from user.

A Harshad number (or Niven number) is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. 

Here is an examples of Harshad numbers:
18:
Sum of digits = 1 + 8 = 9
Since 18 is divisible by 9 (18 รท 9 = 2), 18 is a Harshad number.

Sample Input:Enter a number: 123
Sample Output:123 is not a Harshad number.

Sample Input:Enter a number: 21
Sample Output:21 is a Harshad number.
